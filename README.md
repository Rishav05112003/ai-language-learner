## Project Structure

The repository is organized to leverage Next.js App Router features and maintain a clean separation of concerns.

-   `app/`: Contains all routes and UI pages, organized into route groups like `(auth)` and `(main)`.
-   `actions/`: Server Actions for handling form submissions, database mutations, and AI logic securely on the server.
-   `api/`: API routes for the chatbot (`/api/gemini`), loading chat history (`/api/load-chat`), and handling Inngest background jobs.
-   `components/`: Shared React components, including custom components and `shadcn/ui` elements.
-   `lib/`: Core logic, utility functions, Prisma client instance (`prisma.js`), Zod schemas (`schema.js`), and Inngest client/functions.
-   `prisma/`: Database schema definition (`schema.prisma`) and migration files.
-   `data/`: Static data used across the application, such as language lists and FAQ content.
